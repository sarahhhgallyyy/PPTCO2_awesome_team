## Instructions for using the streamlit visualizer:
1. If you are seeing this then I can safely assume you are in the correct repository. If somehow you arent then start by checking out the dev/streamlit_interface branch. You can do this by running `git checkout dev/streamlit_interface`.  
2. Install the python requirements by running: `pip install -r app/requirements.txt`
3. Once that is done you can run: `streamlit run app/Main.py` This will start a local webpage in your default browser where you can view the streamlit app. If it doesnt automatically open then click the url that is provided in the Terminal after running the aforementioned command.
